# Portfolio

## Task: Creating a coding portfolio from Scratch
* Goal: To properly create a site to display coding work that has been completed. A potential employer should eventually be able to see this as the course progresses to gain an understanding of what tools I have gained. Newly added components will be the first project that was completed and 2 exemplary homework assignments.
* Specifications: Understanding of HTML, CSS, and how to use github are vital to the success of this portfolio. A webiste must be created with a nav bar that leads to different sections in the wepage. It must also link to the resume. The bottom of the webpage will link to my github account and list ways to contact me such as through phone and email. The projects that I have completed so far must be listed, and the background pictures must act as links exhibiting the work.
* Points of Emphasis: Proper formatting and use of HTML and CSS is imperative. Specifically within CSS the use of variables, flex formatting and media specifications for screen size must be used. 
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning HTML, CSS, and READ.ME files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the Link is shown here: https://mitchellm27.github.io/Portfolio/
